# ðŸ“Œ Math Object   

â†’ Math object all you to perform the mathematical tasks on numbers.

â†’ Properties and methods can be called using the Math object.

â†’ Math object works only with the number data type.

â†’ The Math object is a built-in object that has some properties and methods for mathematical calculations.

# ðŸ“Œ Random Method

â†’ This is a method of the Math object that is used to generate random numbers.

â†’ It generates random numbers between 0 and 1 but less than 1.

â†’ But if we want to generate in the bigger range then we have to multiple with that max number. 

â†’ Now the number generated will be between 0 to 100 or 0 to 101 but 101 is not included.

# ðŸ“Œ Trunc Method  

â†’ This is also a method of the Math object that is used to remove fractional digits after the dot.

â†’ Or, it returns the integer value.
