🛠 It's used when we want to build a ludo/dice game.


# 📌 Math Object

→ Math object all you to perform the mathematical tasks on numbers.

→ Properties and methods can be called using the Math object.

→ Math object works only with the number data type.

→ The Math object is a built-in object that has some properties and methods for mathematical calculations.

# 📌 Random Method

→ This is a method of the Math object that is used to generate random numbers.

→ It generates random numbers between 0 and 1 but less than 1.

→ But if we want to generate in the bigger range then we have to multiple with that max number. 

→ Now the number generated will be between 0 to 100 or 0 to 101 but 101 is not included.

# 📌 Trunc Method  

→ This is also a method of the Math object that is used to remove fractional digits after the dot.

→ Or, it returns the integer value.
